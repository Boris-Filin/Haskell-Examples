# Haskell-Examples
 Some examples of my Haskell skills

I know Haskell on an intermediate level.

Most of my Haskell practice came from doing university assignments.
They were much bigger than the files presented here, but I am not sure if I am allowed to share them, since technically they belong to the university (They included a lot of pre-written code).
